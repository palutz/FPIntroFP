# FPIntroFP
FP (fast-paced) introduction to FP (Functional Programming)


Small repository with Jupyer notebooks to share a fast-paced approach to Functional Prgramming (using *Haskell* as a main language) with a team of curious developers



Inspired by [IHaskell, learn you a haskell](https://github.com/IHaskell/learn-you-a-haskell-notebook) and [IOHK, Haskell Course](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course)
